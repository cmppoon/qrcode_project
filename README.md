# qrcode_project


This project can be used as a fake product detection system. The script generates a QR code image and a secret code, and the script will store the secret code in MongoDB database. The product seller can print this QR code and stick it with the product. Customers can scan QR code which to direct to website where customers can type in the secret code. If the secret code matches the code stored in the database, it means that the product is authentic.
